# CoolWoW2
## PLEASE, DON'T USE THIS SITE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, IT CONTAINS LEGACY CODE WITH MANY VULNERABILITIES

This is an unofficial copy of Coolwow programmed by Cirvent. CoolWoW was a website for TrinityCore and MaNGOS with many functionalities (registration, votes, forum, news, server status, database exploration, ...)

### Roadmap :
 * Migrate the code to PHP 8.2
 * Upgrade functionnalities to TrinityCore and MaNGOS
 * Refactoring the code to get it more clean
 * Fixing security issues
 * Adding custom functions
 * Keep the retro theme "style" but with HTML/CSS W3C compatible and mobile compatible

### Warranty :
No waranty given with the current code

### Issues :
Please, report any [issues](https://github.com/galathil/coolwow2/issues) to the tracker and [pull requests](https://github.com/galathil/coolwow2/pulls) are welcoming :)
